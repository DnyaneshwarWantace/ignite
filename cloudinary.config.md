# Cloudinary Configuration

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dwzdr8ei9
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=741397439758848
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=kOPze_jNVA8xgTAA5GsjSTMLLig
```

These credentials are already hardcoded as fallbacks in `lib/cloudinary.ts`, but it's recommended to use environment variables for security.
