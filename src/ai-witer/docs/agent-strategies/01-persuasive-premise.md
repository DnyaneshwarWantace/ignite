# The Persuasive Premise - Complete Strategy Guide

## Overview
The Persuasive Premise is the foundational belief shift that guides your entire marketing campaign. It identifies what your prospect currently believes (that prevents the sale) and what they need to believe instead (that makes the sale inevitable).

## Core Framework

### Part 1: The Main Persuasive Premise

**What It Is:**
The central belief that, when shifted, makes your product/service the obvious choice.

**How to Create It:**
1. Identify the current limiting belief
2. Identify the new empowering belief
3. Create a clear statement connecting them

**Example:**
- **Current Belief:** "I can't afford to hire help"
- **New Belief:** "Hiring help is an investment that pays for itself"
- **Premise:** "The real cost isn't hiring help—it's staying stuck doing everything yourself"

### Part 2: Primary Beliefs

**Definition:**
Core beliefs that directly support the main premise. These are the foundational thoughts that must exist for the premise to work.

**Structure:**
- **Primary Belief #1:** [Core supporting belief]
- **Primary Belief #2:** [Core supporting belief]
- **Primary Belief #3:** [Core supporting belief]

**How to Identify:**
1. What must they believe about the problem?
2. What must they believe about the solution?
3. What must they believe about themselves?

### Part 3: Secondary Beliefs

**Definition:**
Supporting beliefs that reinforce the primary beliefs. These add depth and create a belief system.

**Structure:**
- **Secondary Belief #1:** [Reinforces Primary #1]
- **Secondary Belief #2:** [Reinforces Primary #2]
- **Secondary Belief #3:** [Reinforces Primary #3]

## Proven Strategies

2. **Show Why It's Wrong** - Provide evidence that challenges the belief
3. **Introduce the New Belief** - Present the better belief
4. **Prove It Works** - Show examples, case studies, proof
5. **Make It Theirs** - Help them internalize the new belief

### Strategy 2: The Pattern Interrupt (Russell Brunson)

- Present a surprising insight
- Make them question their current beliefs
- Introduce your premise as the answer

- Ensure it addresses the core issue

### Step 4: Build Supporting Beliefs

## Examples

### Example 1: Business Coaching

- **Premise:** "Success isn't about working more hours—it's about working on the right things"

### Example 2: Marketing Agency
- **Current Belief:** "Marketing is expensive and doesn't work"
- **New Belief:** "Marketing is an investment that pays for itself"
- **Premise:** "The real cost isn't marketing—it's not marketing and watching competitors win"

### Example 3: Online Course
- **Current Belief:** "I don't have time to learn new skills"
- **New Belief:** "Learning new skills saves time in the long run"
- **Premise:** "The time you invest in learning pays dividends for years to come"

## Key Principles

1. **Be Specific** - Vague premises don't work
2. **Be Provable** - You must be able to demonstrate it
3. **Be Relevant** - It must matter to your prospect
4. **Be Memorable** - It should stick in their mind
5. **Be Actionable** - It should lead to a decision

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Generic** - "Our product is great" doesn't shift beliefs
2. **Not Provable** - Can't back it up with evidence
3. **Not Relevant** - Doesn't address their real concerns
4. **Too Complex** - Hard to understand or remember
5. **Not Used Consistently** - Premise changes across materials

## Integration with Other Frameworks

- **Ideal Client Profile:** Premise must resonate with ICP
- **Buying Profiles:** Different profiles may need different premises
- **Ad Funnel:** Premise guides messaging at each level
