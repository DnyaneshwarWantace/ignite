# Problem & Promise - Complete Strategy Guide

## Overview
Problem & Promise is the foundation of all marketing. It clearly defines what problem you solve and what transformation you promise. This framework uses the D.O.R.E.S. criteria to ensure the problem is worth solving and the promise is compelling.

## Core Framework

### THE PROBLEM

#### Main Problem
Clearly define the primary problem your solution addresses.

**Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solve):**
1. **Identify** - What is the problem?
2. **Agitate** - Why does it hurt?
3. **Solve** - How do you fix it?

**Make It Specific:**
- Not: "They need better marketing"
- Yes: "They're spending $50K/month on ads but only generating 5 qualified leads, and their sales team can't close them because the leads aren't properly qualified and don't match their ideal customer profile"

#### Problem Criteria (D.O.R.E.S.)

**D - Desirable:**
- Is solving this problem desirable?
- Do people want it solved?
- Is there demand for a solution?

**O - Observable:**
- Can the problem be observed/measured?
- Can you see it happening?
- Are there clear indicators?

**R - Relevant:**
- Is it relevant to the target market?
- Does it matter to your ideal client?
- Is it a priority for them?

**E - Experienced:**
- Do they actively experience this problem?
- Is it happening now?
- Is it causing real pain?

**S - Specific:**
- Is the problem specific enough?
- Can you clearly define it?
- Is it actionable?

#### Problem Name (If Applicable)
Give the problem a memorable name.

**Why Name It:**
- Makes it ownable
- Easier to reference
- Creates category
- Builds awareness

**Examples:**
- "The Founder's Trap"
- "The Marketing Money Pit"
- "The Growth Plateau"
- "The Scaling Ceiling"

#### The Real Cause
What is the surprising real cause?

**Framework:**
1. **What Most People Think** - Common explanations
2. **What's Actually True** - Real root cause
3. **Why It Matters** - Impact of understanding

**Example:**
- **Common Belief:** "I need to work harder"
- **Real Cause:** "You're working on the wrong things"
- **Why It Matters:** "Working harder on wrong things makes it worse"

### THE PROMISE

#### The Promise
What transformation do you promise?

**Framework (Before-After-Bridge):**
1. **Before State** - Current situation
2. **After State** - Desired outcome
3. **The Bridge** - How you get them there

**Make It Specific:**
- Not: "Better results"
- Yes: "Generate 50+ qualified leads per month, close 30% of them, and scale revenue to $10M ARR within 18 months"

#### Promise Components
What specific results are promised?

**Include:**
- Tangible outcomes
- Measurable results
- Timeframes
- Specific benefits

**Structure:**
- **Practical Benefits** - What they'll achieve
- **Emotional Benefits** - How they'll feel
- **Relational Benefits** - Impact on relationships
- **Financial Benefits** - Economic outcomes

#### Promise Validation
How can you prove this promise?

**Proof Types:**
- Case studies
- Testimonials
- Data and metrics
- Guarantees
- Risk reversal

### CONNECTION

#### How Problem Leads to Promise
How does solving the problem deliver the promise?

**Framework:**
1. **Problem** - Current pain
2. **Solution** - Your approach
3. **Promise** - Transformation
4. **Connection** - How they link

**Example:**
- **Problem:** "Stuck in founder-led sales"
- **Solution:** "Build scalable sales system"
- **Promise:** "Work 20 hours/week while revenue grows"
- **Connection:** "System replaces you, revenue scales, you get freedom"
